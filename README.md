I'm a Hubitat fanatic.  I love tinkering with home automation stuff for at least 45 years.  Hubitat is the latest and greatest in my opinion.
My wife and I live in SW Missouri - not far from Springfield.  We have been retired for 20+ years (retired at 55)
We rescue and foster dogs.
My wife also feeds numerous feral cats, opposum and raccoons.  Plus, of course, birds of all types.  We look after a little over 3 acres and that keeps us busy too.
I was a commercial electrician and have been a memebr of the IBEW for over 50 years.
